Behold the slides to my talk at [Monday's LRUG meeting][lrug-nov], as previously [mentioned][coming-soon]. They're available as a PDF download from the [Speaker Deck page](https://speakerdeck.com/scottmatthewman/hack-like-a-journalist).

Unfortunately, the links don't click on the embedded slide deck, so I've detailed them below.
